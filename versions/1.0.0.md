The Open Gravtext Specification is an open source specification which defines a text-based virtual communication standard designed to allow persons to express emotion with an assigned quantitative value to convey impact, emphasis, etc.

This specification is language-agnostic and unopinionated of its implementation.

## <a name="definitions"></a>Definitions 

**Gravtext Statement:** A Gravtext Statement is the complete syntactical structure composed of the explicit lexical pattern `<Sentiment><Assignment><Tally>`.

**Sentiment:** The Sentiment is the textual expression of emotion.

**Assignment:** The Assingment is the delimeter that marks the end of the Sentiment and the beginning of the Tally.

**Tally:** The Tally is the value assignment of the Sentiment. Tallies are arbitrary pseudo-quantitative valuations. Within the scope of the syntactical rules, all Tallies are valid.

## <a name="basicSyntax"></a>Basic Syntax 

| Component |  Required | Syntax Rules |
| :- | :-: | :- |
| Sentiment | Y | MUST have at least one _alphanumeric_ character immediately to the left of the **Assignment** and at least one MUST be an _alphabetical_ character (case-insensitive). |
| Assignment | Y | MUST be either single _colon_ or _equal sign_ only and placed to the right of the **Sentiment** and to the left of the **Tally**. |
| Tally | Y | MUST begin with an _integer_ character (signed or unsigned) and end with an _integer_ character and MUST be placed to the right of the **Assignment** |

### Examples

### Conjoining Gravtext Statements 

Gravtext Statements MAY be conjoined by delimeting them with a _comma_ character after the last Tally _integer_ character. Whitespaces after the _comma_ and before the next Sentiment's _alphanumeric_ character are legal.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `happy:2,joy:2` |
| Legal | `happy=2, joy=2` |

### Sentiment Naming 

Gravtext Sentiments MAY begin with an _integer_ character provided the last character before the Assignment is _alphabetical_ (case insensitive).

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `2L2Q:100` |

### Truncated Gravtext Statements 

Truncated Gravtext Statements contain multiple Sentiments which MUST be assigned the same Tally.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `happy:joy:2` |

### Conjoined Truncated Gravtext Statements  

Truncated Gravtext Statements MAY be conjoined by delimeting them with a _comma_ character after the last Tally _integer_ character. Whitespaces after the _comma_ and before the next Sentiment's _alphanumeric_ character are legal.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `happy:joy:2,stoked:anxious:ready:10` |
| Legal | `fast:furious:50, dazed:confused:-90` |

### Truncated Sentiment and Assignment Combinations 

Truncated Gravtext Statements MAY have different Assignment characters.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `mellow:calm=relaxed:45` |
| Legal | `glamourous:1000,magical:wonderful=dope:6000` |

### Sentiment Combinations 

A Gravtext Statement MAY contain both truncated and standalone Sentiments.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `happy:joy:2,fullfilled:99` |

### Sentiment Spacing 

Sentiments MAY contain spaces between the first and last _alphanumeric_ characters. 

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal |  `opposite of batman:1000000` |

### Assignment Combinations 

Gravtext Statements that are conjoined MAY have different Assignment characters.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `enthralled=70,intrigued:40` |

### Tally Digit Grouping 

Tallies MAY have digit groupings as any non-numeric character and SHALL exclude the _colon_ and _equal sign_ characters. Remember that Tallies MUST begin with either an _integer_ character (signed or unsigned) and end with an _integer_ character

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `wibbly:1,000,000,000` |
| Legal | `wobbly:1_000_000_000` |
| Legal | `timey:1.000.000.000` |
| Legal | `wimey:1,000_000.000` |

### Tally Spacing 

Tallies MAY have white spaces inbetween the first and last _numeric_ characters. 

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `you were absolutely fantastic:10 0000 0 000, and so was I=9` |

### Tally Emojis 

Tallies MAY have emoji characters inbetween the first and last _numeric_ characters.

| Syntax | Gravtext Statement |
| :- | :- |
| Legal | `the bear is sticky with honey=4üêª000üêª000üêª000` |

### Tally Loading

Tallies MAY have _alphabetical_ characters inbetween the first and last _numeric_ characters.
